NORTH AMERICAN F-100D-25, v.2.0, 26 May 2011, released under Creative Commons license CC-BY-NC-SA

CHANGES FROM V.1.3: Optimized for FlightGear 2.2.  Added operating canopy.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

1.  This is a revised model of Dave Culp's F-100 (see license information below) representing F-100D-25-NA tail number 55-3637, 20 TFW, RAF Weathersfield, UK, 1957.  See Michael Benolkin's excellent web site dedicated to the Hun at http://www.f-100.org/hun.shtml for more information and the color profile I used for the livery.

2.  All livery, added instrumentation, and the AIM-9Bs are my work.

3.  My revisions and additions to the basic model consist primarily of the gun troughs, chute doors, landing gear, gear doors, and wells, but I might have tinkered with other elements I can't remember.

4.  Tire-smoke effects are based on A.J. MacLeod's BAC Lightning F1.A (released under GNU General Public License v. 2).

5.  Pilot and afterburner nozzle/flame 3Ds are based on Gerard Robin's SR-71 (released under GNU General Public License v. 2).

6.  If you recognize your work in this model and I haven't acknowledged it, it's because of my oversight rather than intent.  Please e-mail me at k_esbenshade@hotmail.com and point out my error.  I'll attribute you here.


INSTRUMENTATION NOTES (TOGGLE CONTROL-C FOR PANEL LOCATIONS):

-- Attitude Indicator: Includes horizon adjust click panels on each side of the knob.  Click the knob itself to reset to zero.

-- Auto ILS (control-i): For the lazy among us, flies localizer, glide slope, and airspeed.  You need to be in the reasonable vicinity of all three before you activate the function.

-- Autopilot: Retuned version of the FlightGear generic autopilot for better responsiveness to fighter aircraft.

-- Altimeter:

	Local Weather Fetch Enabled:  Using a Nasal aplet, automatically sets local barometric pressure below 18,000 feet and 29.92, the standard datum plane for pressure altitude in the United States, above 18,000 feet (change-over altitude is different elsewhere).  Indicated altitude is local below 18,000 feet and pressure altitude above 18,000 feet. The autopilot uses indicated altitude for computations.

	Local Weather Fetch Disabled:  Pilot sets manually, and autopilot uses indicated altitude for computations.

-- Radio Navigation Instruments (RDMI, ILS, & DME):  The Radio Direction Magnetic Indicator (RDMI) contains both VOR (number 1, narrow needle) and TACAN (number 2, wide needle).  DME and ILS indicators are functional and accurate for the aircraft.

LICENSE:  

Below is the original license that Dave Culp published with the F-100 model on which this model is based.  It was released as Freeware, Non-Commercial.  This model cannot be sold, and cannot be used for commercial use.

  Dave converted this model to AC3D format, redid the landing gear, cockpit, external stores and textures, and added the refueling probe.  This model is now designed to run on FlightGear v1.0 plus the newer JSBSim version which contains "system capability".
